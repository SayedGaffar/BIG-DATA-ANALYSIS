## In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of Diwali Sales Data using Dask to handle the large dataset efficiently. The objective was to derive insights into customer purchasing behavior, sales performance, and demographic trends during the Diwali season using scalable data processing

#### The raw data is available as Diwali sales data.csv file and after doing the analysis the completed file is available as cleaned diwali sales.csv file
